## **IGV 2.3,** released April 2013

**New Features and Improvements**

*   **Motif finder.** This new feature allows you to search for a particular nucleotide sequence in the reference genome, using either regular expression syntax or IUPAC ambiguity codes. Search results are displayed in two new tracks; one displays matches on the positive strand, and the other displays matches on the negative strand. Read more about it [here](http://www.broadinstitute.org/software/igv/node/251).

*   **Copy details of alignment coverage track to the clipboard. **If you hover the mouse cursor over a sequence alignment coverage track, the pop-up window shows details about the reads at that locus, including the number of reads, and the distribution of called nucleotides. You can now copy this information to your computer's clipboard by right-clicking and selecting _Copy Details to Clipboard _from the menu.

*   **Improved memory performance for BAM files.** In this release, sequence alignments that are no longer in view are purged from memory more frequently than before. "Out of memory" messages should happen less often.

*   **Gitools integration.** Gitools is a framework, developed at the Biomedical Research Park in Barcelona (PRBB), for analysis and visualization of genomic data. Data and results are represented as browsable heatmaps. Data can be exported from IGV in gitools format, or loaded directly into a running gitools session. Available under the _Tools_ menu. See http://www.gitools.org for details. 

##### Bug Fixes

*   Improved parsing of GFF3 files, so alternate coding sequences are displayed properly.
*   Fixed loading of BAM files over FTP.
*   Fixed bug where "Load Genome" dialog was sometimes blank.
*   Set autoscale to false when scale manually set, don't disable "Set Data Range" when autoscale set.
*   Trim any leading bases from VCF files which match the reference, so variants are displayed where the variation actually starts.

# **IGV 2.3.46 March 16**, 2015

**New Features and Improvements**

*   **BLAT. **You can now do a BLAT search from a _feature_, _alignment_, or _region of interest, _of up to 8 kb in length as detailed [here](http://www.broadinstitute.org/software/igv/BLAT).
    *   **Features:** <span>Right-click on the feature in the track to see the BLAT command in the pop-up menu. The BLAT input sequence is the section of the reference genome defined by the feature start and end bounds.</span>
    *   **Alignments:** Right-click on the aligned read to see the BLAT command in the pop-up menu. The BLAT input sequence is the read sequence. It is _not _the sequence of the reference genome where the read was aligned.
    *   **Regions of Interest: **After [creating a region of interest](http://www.broadinstitute.org/software/igv/regionsofinterest), click on the region's red bar to see the BLAT command in the popup menu. The BLAT input sequence is the sequence of the reference genome defined by the region bounds.<span>   </span>

<span>​</span>By default, the BLAT server hosted at the UCSC Genome Browser is used, but this can be changed in the _Advanced_ preferences (_View > Preferences > Advanced_). Most UCSC derived genomes are supported, including human and mouse genomes.

*   <span>​</span>**Combine numeric tracks.** From the _Tools _menu, you can now dynamically create new tracks by combining two existing numeric tracks. Operators include add, subtract, multiply, and divide. Note that this does not overlay the two tracks, but rather creates a new data track that combines the data values from both tracks. For example, if you multiply two tracks, and one track has a data value of 10 at a particular locus, and the other track has a value of 2 at that locus, then the new track will have a value of 20. 

*   **Support for Supplementary Alignments**
    *   <span>Added a new alignment preference to filter supplementary alignments. See _Filter and shading options_ in </span>_View > Preferences > Alignments_<span>.</span>
    *   <span>Added _Group by supplementary flag_ to the alignment popup track menu.</span>
    *   <span>Enhanced the pop-up information panel, also referred to as a tooltip, for supplementary alignments.</span>

</div>

*   <span>**Misc**</span>
    *   <span>Session file paths are now relative where possible (i.e. data file path is relative to session path).</span>
    *   <span>Added a new batch command to go to whole genome view: “goto all”.  </span>
    *   <span>You can now optionally disable quality weighting of the allele fraction when displaying single nucleotide mismatches in the coverage track for sequencing data. See "Filter and shading options" in </span>_View > Preferences > Alignments_<span>.</span>
    *   <span>Nucleotide colors for the sequence track are now settable by adding or editing properties COLOR.A, COLOR.C, COLOR.T, COLOR.G, and COLOR.N in the IGV _pref.properties_ file (see the _igv _directory in your home directory). Similarly for a BAM track with properties SAM.COLOR.A, SAM.COLOR.C, etc., as outlined [here](http://www.broadinstitute.org/software/igv/prefs.properties).</span>
    *   <span>The exon numbering scheme has been changed to begin at first _coding_ exon, rather than first exon.</span>
    *   <span>Increased the keyboard left/right scroll speed to 50 pixels per key press.</span>
    *   <span>Improved memory management for smaller BAM file footprint.</span>
